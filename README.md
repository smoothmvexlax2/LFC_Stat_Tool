# LFC_Stat_Tool
This a wrapper I made for my statistics project. I wanted something to allow me to investigate data sets, which hold both qualitative and quantitative data sets. I used various stat packages for calculations and plotting based off convenience and what I had pre-built.

# Potential issues
If one is not careful, the number of graph outputs can cause runtime errors. My regression functions is set up for only one independent variable. 

# Necessary Packages
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

# Possible Upgrades
1) I may update this wrapper to read other files besides csv. 
2) Some of the graph outputs need larger fonts, but I may add an arg for font size in the constructor.
